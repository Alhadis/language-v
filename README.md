V language support
==================

Port of [**@0x9ef**][]'s [VSCode extension][1] for [V language][2] support.

This "port" is essentially a copy of [**@0x9ef**][]'s work, with some files
renamed. Please don't suggest improvements or submit corrections here; send
them [upstream][1] instead, and updates will eventually be picked up here.
